# Development Workflow

## Database Operations
- Use `npm run db:push` to sync schema changes
- Use `npm run db:generate` to regenerate Prisma client
- Use `npm run db:studio` to view/edit data
- Use `npm run db:seed` to populate initial data

## Code Organization
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use proper file naming conventions
- Group related functionality together
- Follow the established folder structure

## Testing & Debugging
- Use browser dev tools for debugging
- Check network tab for API issues
- Use Prisma Studio for database inspection
- Test both desktop and mobile views

## Performance Considerations
- Use Next.js Image component for images
- Implement proper loading states
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize database queries with proper includes

## Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Use proper authentication checks
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

## Deployment
- Test all functionality before deployment
- Ensure environment variables are set
- Run database migrations if needed (`npm run db:migrate`)
